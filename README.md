# Data-Analysis

The purpose of this project is to get familiar with Data Analysis using python pandas, numpy and matplot libraries. 

I choose to analyse Los Angeles Crime rate between 2012 - 2016 because I live and study here!

Overview
=============
We used an open dataset approved and upload by LAPD. [link here](https://data.lacity.org/browse?category=A+Safe+City&q=crime&sortBy=relevance&utf8=%E2%9C%93) 

An interesting inference can be derived by end of this project. 

*When the schools are closed then there are high chances of crime in my area. OR When we observe high crime in Southwest of Los Angeles, then it implies that USC is closed for vacation!*
